# Soap [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Downloads][downloads-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]
> A SOAP client and server for node.js.

This module lets you connect to web services using SOAP.  It also provides a server that allows you to run your own SOAP services.

## Features:

* Very simple API
* Handles both RPC and Document schema types
* Supports multiRef SOAP messages (thanks to [@kaven276](https://github.com/kaven276))
* Support for both synchronous and asynchronous method handlers
* WS-Security (currently only UsernameToken and PasswordText encoding is supported)

## Install

Install with [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):

```
  npm install soap
```
## Module

### soap.createClient(url[, options], callback) - create a new SOAP client from a WSDL url. Also supports a local filesystem path.

``` javascript
  var soap = require('soap');
  var url = 'http://example.com/wsdl?wsdl';
  var args = {name: 'value'};
  soap.createClient(url, function(err, client) {
      client.MyFunction(args, function(err, result) {
          console.log(result);
      });
  });
```

Within the options object you may provide an `endpoint` property in case you want to override the SOAP service's host specified in the `.wsdl` file.

### soap.listen(*server*, *path*, *services*, *wsdl*) - create a new SOAP server that listens on *path* and provides *services*.
*wsdl* is an xml string that defines the service.

``` javascript
  var myService = {
      MyService: {
          MyPort: {
              MyFunction: function(args) {
                  return {
                      name: args.name
                  };
              },

              // This is how to define an asynchronous function.
              MyAsyncFunction: function(args, callback) {
                  // do some work
                  callback({
                      name: args.name
                  })
              },

              // This is how to receive incoming headers
              HeadersAwareFunction: function(args, cb, headers) {
                  return {
                      name: headers.Token
                  };
              }
          }
      }
  }

  var xml = require('fs').readFileSync('myservice.wsdl', 'utf8'),
      server = http.createServer(function(request,response) {
          response.end("404: Not Found: "+request.url)
      });

  server.listen(8000);
  soap.listen(server, '/wsdl', myService, xml);
```

### server logging

If the log method is defined it will be called with 'received' and 'replied'
along with data.

``` javascript
  server = soap.listen(...)
  server.log = function(type, data) {
    // type is 'received' or 'replied'
  };
```

### SOAP Fault

A service method can reply with a SOAP Fault to a client by `throw`ing an
object with a `Fault` property.

``` javascript
  throw {
    Fault: {
      Code: {
        Value: "soap:Sender",
        Subcode: { value: "rpc:BadArguments" }
      },
      Reason: { Text: "Processing Error" }
    }
  };
```

### SOAP Headers

A service method can look at the SOAP headers by providing a 3rd arguments.

``` javascript
  {
      HeadersAwareFunction: function(args, cb, headers) {
          return {
              name: headers.Token
          };
      }
  }
```

It is also possible to subscribe to the 'headers' event.
The event is triggered before the service method is called, and only when the
SOAP Headers are not empty.

``` javascript
  server = soap.listen(...)
  server.on('headers', function(headers, methodName) {
    // It is possible to change the value of the headers
    // before they are handed to the service method.
    // It is also possible to throw a SOAP Fault
  });
```

First parameter is the Headers object;
second parameter is the name of the SOAP method that will called
(in case you need to handle the headers differently based on the method).

### server security example using PasswordDigest

If server.authenticate is not defined no authentation will take place.

``` javascript
  server = soap.listen(...)
  server.authenticate = function(security) {
    var created, nonce, password, user, token;
    token = security.UsernameToken, user = token.Username,
            password = token.Password, nonce = token.Nonce, created = token.Created;
    return user === 'user' && password === soap.passwordDigest(nonce, created, 'password');
  };
```

### server connection authorization

This is called prior to soap service method
If the method is defined and returns false the incoming connection is
terminated.

``` javascript
  server = soap.listen(...)
  server.authorizeConnection = function(req) {
    return true; // or false
  };
```


## Client

An instance of Client is passed to the soap.createClient callback.  It is used to execute methods on the soap service.

### Client.describe() - description of services, ports and methods as a JavaScript object

``` javascript
  client.describe() // returns
    {
      MyService: {
        MyPort: {
          MyFunction: {
            input: {
              name: 'string'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

### Client.setSecurity(security) - use the specified security protocol
`node-soap` has several default security protocols.  You can easily add your own
as well.  The interface is quite simple.  Each protocol defines 2 methods:
* addOptions - a method that accepts an options arg that is eventually passed directly to `request`
* toXML - a method that reurns a string of XML.

By default there are 3 protocols:

####BasicAuthSecurity

``` javascript
  client.setSecurity(new soap.BasicAuthSecurity('username', 'password'));
```

####ClientSSLSecurity
_Note_: If you run into issues using this protocol, consider passing these options
as default request options to the constructor:
* rejectUnauthorized: false
* strictSSL: false
* secureOptions: constants.SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_2//this is likely needed for node >= 10.0

``` javascript
  client.setSecurity(new soap.ClientSSLSecurity(
    '/path/to/key'
    , '/path/to/cert'
    , {/*default request options*/}
  ));
```

####WSSecurity

``` javascript
  client.setSecurity(new soap.WSSecurity('username', 'password'))
```

####BearerSecurity

``` javascript
  client.setSecurity(new soap.BearerSecurity('token'));
```

### Client.*method*(args, callback) - call *method* on the SOAP service.

``` javascript
  client.MyFunction({name: 'value'}, function(err, result, raw, soapHeader) {
      // result is a javascript object
      // raw is the raw response
      // soapHeader is the response soap header as a javascript object
  })
```
### Client.*service*.*port*.*method*(args, callback[, options]) - call a *method* using a specific *service* and *port*

``` javascript
  client.MyService.MyPort.MyFunction({name: 'value'}, function(err, result) {
      // result is a javascript object
  })
```
#### Options (optional)
 - Accepts any option that the request module accepts, see [here.](https://github.com/mikeal/request)
 - For example, you could set a timeout of 5 seconds on the request like this:
``` javascript
  client.MyService.MyPort.MyFunction({name: 'value'}, function(err, result) {
      // result is a javascript object
  }, {timeout: 5000})
```

### Client.*addSoapHeader*(soapHeader[, name, namespace, xmlns]) - add soapHeader to soap:Header node
#### Options

 - `soapHeader`     Object({rootName: {name: "value"}}) or strict xml-string

##### Optional parameters when first arg is object :
 - `name`           Unknown parameter (it could just a empty string)
 - `namespace`      prefix of xml namespace
 - `xmlns`          URI

### Client.*lastRequest* - the property that contains last full soap request for client logging

### Client Events
Client instances emit the following events:

* request - Emitted before a request is sent. The event handler receives the 
entire Soap request (Envelope) including headers.
* message - Emitted before a request is sent. The event handler receives the 
Soap body contents. Useful if you don't want to log /store Soap headers.
* soapError - Emitted when an erroneous response is received.
  Useful if you want to globally log errors.


## WSSecurity

WSSecurity implements WS-Security.  UsernameToken and PasswordText/PasswordDigest is supported. An instance of WSSecurity is passed to Client.setSecurity.

``` javascript
  new WSSecurity(username, password, passwordType)
    //'PasswordDigest' or 'PasswordText' default is PasswordText
```

## Handling XML Attributes, Value and XML (wsdlOptions).
Sometimes it is necessary to override the default behaviour of `node-soap` in order to deal with the special requirements
of your code base or a third library you use. Therefore you can use the `wsdlOptions` Object, which is passed in the
`#createClient()` method and could have any (or all) of the following contents:
```javascript
var wsdlOptions = {
  attributesKey: 'theAttrs',
  valueKey: 'theVal',
  xmlKey: 'theXml'
}
```
If nothing (or an empty Object `{}`) is passed to the `#createClient()` method, the `node-soap` defaults (`attributesKey: 'attributes'`, `valueKey: '$value'` and `xmlKey: '$xml'`) are used.

###Overriding the `value` key
By default, `node-soap` uses `$value` as key for any parsed XML value which may interfere with your other code as it
could be some reserved word, or the `$` in general cannot be used for a key to start with.

You can define your own `valueKey` by passing it in the `wsdl_options` to the createClient call like so:
```javascript
var wsdlOptions = {
  valueKey: 'theVal'
};

soap.createClient(__dirname + '/wsdl/default_namespace.wsdl', wsdlOptions, function (err, client) {
  // your code
});
```

###Overriding the `xml` key
As `valueKey`, `node-soap` uses `$xml` as key. The xml key is used to pass XML Object without adding namespace or parsing the string.

Example :

```javascript
dom = {
     $xml: '<parentnode type="type"><childnode></childnode></parentnode>'
};
```

```xml
<tns:dom>
    <parentnode type="type">
          <childnode></childnode>
    </parentnode>
</tns:dom>
```

You can define your own `xmlKey` by passing it in the `wsdl_options` to the createClient call like so:
```javascript
var wsdlOptions = {
  xmlKey: 'theXml'
};

soap.createClient(__dirname + '/wsdl/default_namespace.wsdl', wsdlOptions, function (err, client) {
  // your code
});
```

###Overriding the `attributes` key
You can achieve attributes like:
``` xml
<parentnode>
  <childnode name="childsname">
  </childnode>
</parentnode>
```
By attaching an attributes object to a node.
``` javascript
{
  parentnode: {
    childnode: {
      attributes: {
        name: 'childsname'
      }
    }
  }
}
```
However, "attributes" may be a reserved key for some systems that actually want a node
```xml
<attributes>
</attributes>
```

In this case you can configure the attributes key in the `wsdlOptions` like so.
```javascript
var wsdlOptions = {
  attributesKey: '$attributes'
};

soap.createClient(__dirname + '/wsdl/default_namespace.wsdl', wsdlOptions, function (err, client) {
  client.*method*({
    parentnode: {
      childnode: {
        $attributes: {
          name: 'childsname'
        }
      }
    }
  });
});
```

## Handling "ignored" namespaces
If an Element in a `schema` definition depends on an Element which is present in the same namespace, normally the `tns:`
namespace prefix is used to identify this Element. This is not much of a problem as long as you have just one `schema` defined
(inline or in a separate file). If there are more `schema` files, the `tns:` in the generated `soap` file resolved mostly to the parent `wsdl` file,
 which was obviously wrong.

 `node-soap` now handles namespace prefixes which shouldn't be resolved (because it's not necessary) as so called `ignoredNamespaces`
 which default to an Array of 3 Strings (`['tns', 'targetNamespace', 'typedNamespace']`).

 If this is not sufficient for your purpose you can easily add more namespace prefixes to this Array, or override it in its entirety
 by passing an `ignoredNamespaces` object within the `options` you pass in `soap.createClient()` method.

 A simple `ignoredNamespaces` object, which only adds certain namespaces could look like this:
 ```
 var options = {
   ignoredNamespaces: {
     namespaces: ['namespaceToIgnore', 'someOtherNamespace']
   }
 }
 ```
 This would extend the `ignoredNamespaces` of the `WSDL` processor to `['tns', 'targetNamespace', 'typedNamespace', 'namespaceToIgnore', 'someOtherNamespace']`.

 If you want to override the default ignored namespaces you would simply pass the following `ignoredNamespaces` object within the `options`:
 ```
 var options = {
     ignoredNamespaces: {
       namespaces: ['namespaceToIgnore', 'someOtherNamespace'],
       override: true
     }
   }
 ```
 This would override the default `ignoredNamespaces` of the `WSDL` processor to `['namespaceToIgnore', 'someOtherNamespace']`. (This shouldn't be necessary, anyways).
